[![Compile AutoHotkey scripts](https://github.com/TheCrether/ahkscripts/actions/workflows/action.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/TheCrether/ahkscripts/actions/workflows/action.yml)

I press my i3 shortcuts too often on my Windows machines without a result. That's the one of the reasons I made this repo.

## Prerequisites

- [AutoHotkey](https://www.autohotkey.com/)
  - Version: any **v2** version

## What each file does

### `desktop.ahk`

This uses [Ciantic/VirtualDesktopAccessor][1], a DLL from where you can access Windows Desktop functions. I just put an already built [./VirtualDesktopAccessor.dll](./VirtualDesktopAccessor.dll) in this repository, but you free to build one yourself.

I will refer to `n` as the desktop number, which is limited to 9 in my script because the hotkeys are dynamically created for the number of available desktops (on startup and on addition/removal of desktops) and I can only create shortcuts for 1-9 automatically (key 1 to key 9).

- `Win + n` to switch between desktop
- `Win + Shift + n` to move a window to a desktop
- `Win + Alt + n` to move a window to a desktop and also switch to the desktop

Additionally, it can restart the explorer with `Win + Shift + r` and can rotate your main display:

- `Win + F1` for a normal horizontal display
- `Win + F2` to rotate 90째 degrees counterclockwise (normal vertical display)
- `Win + F3` to rotate 180째 degrees counterclockwise (flipped horizontal display)
- `Win + F4` to rotate 270째 degrees counterclockwise (flipped vertical display)

You can also send a message from other AutoHotkey scripts, like this:

```autohotkey
desktop := WinExist("desktop.ahk ahk_class AutoHotkey")
PostMessage(0x5555, 0, 1, , "ahk_id " . desktop) ; 0 is to send a change desktop request, 1 is to change it the 2nd desktop (index starts at 0)
```

### `shortcuts.ah2`

This is a script to launch shortcuts configured through a JSON file. You can put folders you want to open, Batch/Powershell/Autohotkey scripts to launch and also put them into submenus.

Because of Windows-version specific limitations, some features may not be available. (described after this)

#### Windows 10

You can use this script to define a list of shortcuts which can open one folder in explorer or start a AutoHotkey script (path has to end with .ahk or .ah2).

Path for JSON: `YOUR-HOME\shortcuts\shortcuts.json`

Example JSON:

```json
{
  "shortcuts": {
    "work": "C:\\work",
    "temp": "C:\\Temp",
    "my-script-ah2": "C:\\scripts\\hello-world.ah2",
    "my-script-ahk": "C:\\scripts\\hello-world.ahk",
    "submenu": {
      "home": "C:\\Users\\user",
      "goingDown": {
        "wow": "C:\\"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

#### **For Windows 11 only**

This script can open an W11 explorer with multiple tabs through a JSON configuration in your user folder  (scripts look in the environment variables `USERPROFILE` and `HOME` in order).

Path for JSON: `YOUR-HOME\shortcuts\shortcuts.json`

Example JSON:

```json
{
  "shortcuts": {
    "work": [
      "C:\\work",
      "C:\\Users\\user\\another-work-folder"
    ],
    "temp": "C:\\Temp",
    "my-script-ah2": "C:\\scripts\\hello-world.ah2",
    "my-script-ahk": "C:\\scripts\\hello-world.ahk",
    "submenu": {
      "home": "C:\\Users\\user",
      "goingDown": {
        "wow": "C:\\"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### `i3help.ahk`

It has the general shortcuts that I use like media control, focusing windows, setting windows to be always-on-top.

- `Ctrl + Alt + p` - play/pause
- `Ctrl + Alt + Left/Right` & `Ctrl + AltGr + Left/Right` - previous/next song
- `Win + q` & `Win + Shift + q` - close active window (sends `Alt + F4`)
- `Win + Shift + p` - trigger Windows power menu
- `Win + x` - open AHK WindowSpy for window information
- `Win + Shift + x` - open my own gui for searching windows informations through WinGetList with the standard ahk filters
- `Win + a` - Activate Discord
- `Win + s` - Activate Spotify
- `Win + Enter` & `Win + Alt + t` - Open Windows Terminal
- `Win + t` - Set windows to AlwaysOnTop
- `Win + Shift + 1` - resize window to a little less than 40% screen height and scale the width proportionally
- `Win + Shift + a` - click the notificiation icon at the bottom right (on W10 and W11)
- `Win + m` - (un-)minimize a window
- `Ctrl + Alt + v` - open a context menu for transforming somewhat valid file paths in the clipboard to:
  - with backlashes/slashes/custom separator
  - add a prefix/suffix

#### In the Windows explorer

- `Ctrl + v` - can paste an image into the currently open explorer window (active tab on W11)
- `Ctrl + Shift + c` - copy the path(s) of the currently selected item(s)
- `Ctrl + Shift + e` - edit the currently selected item(s)

### `startall.ahk`

Starts my AutoHotkey scripts at once (useful for autostart)

### `vowels.ahk`

Has the hotstrings for when I use the US keyboard layout (most of the time now) instead of the German keyboard layout.

converts stuff like: `ae-` to `채` with the specified hot strings triggers at the top

## `Lib/winhook.ahk`

This script comes from the AutoHotkey forums. It's a really cool script for listening to all kinds of window messages.
