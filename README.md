[![Compile AutoHotkey scripts](https://github.com/TheCrether/ahkscripts/actions/workflows/action.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/TheCrether/ahkscripts/actions/workflows/action.yml)

I press my i3 shortcuts too often on my Windows machines without a result. That's the one of the reasons I made this repo.

## Prerequisites

- [AutoHotkey](https://www.autohotkey.com/)
  - Version: any **v2** version

## What each file does

### `desktop.ahk`

This uses [Ciantic/VirtualDesktopAccessor][1], a DLL from where you can access Windows Desktop functions. I just put an already built [./VirtualDesktopAccessor.dll](./VirtualDesktopAccessor.dll) in this repository, but you free to build one yourself.

I will refer to `n` as the desktop number, which is limited to 9 in my script because the hotkeys are dynamically created for the number of available desktops (on startup and on addition/removal of desktops) and I can only create shortcuts for 1-9 automatically (key 1 to key 9).

- `Win + n` to switch between desktop
- `Win + Shift + n` to move a window to a desktop
- `Win + Alt + n` to move a window to a desktop and also switch to the desktop

Additionally, it can restart the explorer with `Win + Shift + r` and can rotate your main display:

- `Win + F1` for a normal horizontal display
- `Win + F2` to rotate 90째 degrees counterclockwise (normal vertical display)
- `Win + F3` to rotate 180째 degrees counterclockwise (flipped horizontal display)
- `Win + F4` to rotate 270째 degrees counterclockwise (flipped vertical display)

You can also send a message from other AutoHotkey scripts, like this:

```autohotkey
desktop := WinExist("desktop.ah2 ahk_class AutoHotkey")
PostMessage(0x5555, 0, 1, , "ahk_id " . desktop) ; 0 is to send a change desktop request, 1 is to change it the 2nd desktop (index starts at 0)
```

### `shortcuts.ah2`

#### Windows 10

You can use this script to define a list of shortcuts which can open one folder in explorer or start a AutoHotkey script (path has to end with .ahk or .ah2).

Path for JSON: `YOUR-HOME\explorer-shortcuts.json`

Example JSON:

```json
{
  "shortcuts": {
    "work": "C:\\work",
    "temp": "C:\\Temp",
    "my-script-ah2": "C:\\scripts\\hello-world.ah2",
    "my-script-ahk": "C:\\scripts\\hello-world.ahk"
  }
}
```

#### **For Windows 11 only**

This script can open an W11 explorer with multiple tabs through a JSON configuration in your user folder  (scripts look in the environment variables `USERPROFILE` and `HOME` in order).

Path for JSON: `YOUR-HOME\explorer-shortcuts.json`

Example JSON:

```json
{
  "shortcuts": {
    "work": [
      "C:\\work",
      "C:\\Users\\user\\another-work-folder"
    ],
    "temp": "C:\\Temp",
    "my-script-ah2": "C:\\scripts\\hello-world.ah2",
    "my-script-ahk": "C:\\scripts\\hello-world.ahk"
  }
}
```

### `i3help.ahk`

It has the general shortcuts that I use like media control, focusing windows, setting windows to be always-on-top. Example: `Win + a` to activate Discord

### `startall.ahk`

Starts my AutoHotkey scripts at once (useful for autostart)

### `vowels.ahk`

Has the hotstrings for when I use the US keyboard layout (most of the time now) instead of the German keyboard layout.

converts stuff like: `ae` to `채` with the specified hot strings triggers at the top

## `winhook.ahk`

This script comes from the AutoHotkey forums. It's a really cool script for listening to all kinds of window messages.
